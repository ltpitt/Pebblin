# Releasing Pebblin

Pebblin releases produce both the Android APK and Pebble watchapp PBW from
the same release workflow.

## Makefile shortcuts

Common operations are wrapped in a `Makefile` (a thin wrapper over
`scripts/*.sh` — the scripts also work standalone, e.g. `./scripts/build-debug.sh`).
Run `make help` for the full list. Highlights:

- `make build` — build a debug APK locally.
- `make check` — run the same lint/detekt/buildHealth checks as CI, locally,
  before pushing.
- `make test` — run unit tests.
- `make install` — build the debug APK and install it via `adb`.
- `make watchapp-install` — build the Pebble watchapp and install it on a
  watch connected through the Pebble phone app. Set `PEBBLE_PHONE_IP` to the
  phone's developer-connection IP for a direct connection.
- `make quick-release` — trigger the `quick-build` workflow on the current
  branch and print the resulting `debug-latest` release URL when done.
- `make release` — trigger the full `develop-build` release workflow.
- `make releases` — list recent GitHub Releases.

## Quick debug build (for trying changes on a phone)

If you just want an installable APK to sideload and test, without waiting for
the full test/lint/screenshot-test/watchapp/versioning pipeline, use the
`quick-build` workflow in `.github/workflows/quick-build.yaml`:

1. Open **Actions → quick-build → Run workflow**, pick your branch, and fill
   the required `quick_release_id` input with a unique value before starting
   it. Alternatively, run `make quick-release`, which generates the unique
   value automatically.
2. It builds the Android debug APK and Pebble watchapp PBW — no tests, no lint,
   and no versioning.
3. Download the Android APK and Pebble PBW from the run's **Artifacts** section:
   `pebblin-mobile-debug-apk` contains only the Android APK, while
   `pebblin-quick-build` contains both the Android APK and Pebble PBW. Both
   are also available from the `debug-latest` prerelease.

This build is signed with the debug key. It is published as the rolling
`debug-latest` **prerelease** on GitHub (overwritten on every run), containing
both the Android debug APK and Pebble watchapp PBW — see
`https://github.com/ltpitt/Pebblin/releases/tag/debug-latest`. It is
not a substitute for the full `develop-build` release below.

## Automated release

The canonical process is the `develop-build` workflow in
`.github/workflows/develop.yaml`.

1. Merge changes into `main` using conventional commits. Use `fix:` for a
   patch release, `feat:` for a minor release, and a breaking-change marker
   for a major release.
2. Open **Actions → develop-build → Run workflow**, select `main`, and start
   the workflow. The workflow also runs daily at 07:00 UTC.
3. The workflow checks for new `fix` or `feat` commits since the version
   recorded in `version.txt`. If none exist, it skips the release.
4. It calculates the next Pebble-compatible version, updates:
   `version.txt`, `mobile/version.txt`, `watch/version.txt`, and
   `watch/package.json`, then commits and tags that version.
5. It builds and tests the Android app and Pebble watchapp, then creates a
   GitHub Release containing:
   - `mobile/app/build/outputs/apk/release/pebblin-mobile.apk`
   - `watch/build/pebblin-watchapp.pbw`

Do not manually edit the version files for a normal release. The workflow
keeps the Android and watch versions aligned when both components changed; if
only one component changed, the release notes link to the previous version of
the unchanged component.

## Required repository configuration

The workflow needs:

- GitHub Actions enabled for the repository.
- Workflow permissions that allow `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push commits and tags and
  create releases. On a fork this defaults to **read-only** and must be
  changed explicitly: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow
  permissions → Read and write permissions** (or
  `gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions/workflow -f default_workflow_permissions=write`).
  Without this, the workflow fails at the "Push version" step with
  `remote: Permission ... denied` / `403`.
- Repository secrets `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` and
  `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` for the signed Android release build (see the
  note below if this fork does not have the original password).
- Git LFS and recursive submodules available to the checkout.

### Known issue on this fork: lost release keystore password

`mobile/keys/release.jks` is byte-identical to the upstream repository's file,
but the password that protects it was never part of this fork's secrets and
could not be recovered. As a temporary measure, `mobile/app/build.gradle.kts`
signs the `release` build type with the **debug** signing config instead of
`release`. This keeps the automated pipeline working, but:

- The resulting APK is signed with the debug key, not suitable for Play Store
  distribution or any channel that expects a stable, private signing key.
- If you obtain the real `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` /
  `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, set them as repository secrets and revert the
  `signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug")` line in
  `mobile/app/build.gradle.kts` back to
  `signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")`.
- If the password is permanently unrecoverable, generate a new release
  keystore, store its password as a repository secret, and replace
  `mobile/keys/release.jks`. Note this changes the app's signing identity,
  which matters if the app is ever published somewhere that checks signatures
  (e.g. Play Store update compatibility).

The release job also installs the Pebble SDK and uses Java 21 for the Android
build. These tools are installed by the workflow; they are not prerequisites
on the computer that starts the workflow.

## Before relying on a release

Confirm that the workflow is visible and manually dispatchable in the Actions
tab. If GitHub does not list `develop-build`, inspect the workflow YAML and
repository Actions settings before attempting a release. A file that exists in
`.github/workflows/` but is not registered by GitHub cannot be dispatched.

Check the generated changelog URLs in `develop.yaml` when transferring the
repository to a different owner. They must point to the actual GitHub
repository, not the original upstream owner.

## Manual fallback

Use a manual release only when the workflow cannot be repaired in time. Build
the signed Android APK and Pebble PBW with the same version, run the same
tests, tag the version, and upload both artifacts to a GitHub Release. Record
the reason for bypassing automation and update this guide if the workflow
contract changes.
