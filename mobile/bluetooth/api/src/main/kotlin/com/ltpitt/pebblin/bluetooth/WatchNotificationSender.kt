 * Posts a normal Android phone notification containing a title and a body.

 * produces an ordinary Pebble notification: one that pops up, can be read and dismissed, and
 * stays in the watch's notification history - exactly like every other mirrored phone
 * notification.
 *
 * Shared between the Tasker `SEND_NOTIFICATION` action and the in-app notification test tool so
 * both produce the exact same notification.
