# Watch Event Callbacks Design

## Goal

Expose optional Pebble interaction events—tap, wrist twist, and battery state—
to Tasker without coupling them to interactive screen requests.

## Design

Add a separate event subscription/request path. Tasker configures which event
types are enabled and supplies an event identifier; the watch sends typed,
bounded event messages with timestamps where available. Events are
best-effort, do not suspend a Tasker action, and are never confused with
terminal interactive results.

Battery events are rate-limited and sent only on meaningful state changes.
Tap and twist events are emitted only when the watch can observe them reliably.
The phone maps events to Tasker broadcasts or variables using the existing
plugin integration. Event messages use packet 16 (`WATCH_EVENT`); see the
[packet registry](../reference/protocol-and-results.md#packet-id-allocation).
Lineage is tracked in the [parity matrix](../reference/autopebble-parity-matrix.md).

### Deferred: motion (accelerometer X/Y/Z) streaming

AutoPebble streamed raw accelerometer X/Y/Z values to Tasker. Pebblin defers
this: continuous motion streaming drains the battery and serves a narrow use
case. It is classified **Dropped (deferred)** in the parity matrix and is not
part of this feature's first implementation. Revisit only with real-device
demand, reusing the `WATCH_EVENT` path with an explicit rate cap.

## Failure handling and testing

Validate subscriptions, rate limits, event IDs, and protocol versions. Test
duplicate delivery, reconnects, disabled events, battery thresholds, and
screen/session coexistence. Implement this last after the request/response
features have real-device validation.
